# The Event Model format

One or more YAML files. `em.py` merges every `.yaml` file it is given, or every one under a folder it is given.
A full example: `examples/vendy.em.yaml`. A starting point: `templates/model.em.yaml`.

## Top level

| Key | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `system` | The system's name |
| `actors` | Who acts on screens: `[Visitor, Seller]` |
| `externals` | Outside systems and the outcomes a test can force: `AIModels: {outcomes: {succeeds: aiRenderSucceeds, fails: aiRenderFails}}`. The value of an outcome is the name of the e2e fixture that forces it. A plain list `[AIModels]` is allowed while there are no outcomes yet |
| `clock` | `true` when something happens on time (renewals, expiry): automations may use `trigger: clock` and specs may use `after` |
| `domains` | Value sets for decision tables: `Plan: [Starter, Seller, Scale]` |
| `rules` | Decision tables and formulas (below) |
| `screens` | Optional. Where a screen lives and the Page Object that drives it: `CreateAdPage: {route: /next/static-ad, pom: staticAdPage}`. Without it the Page Object is the screen's name in lowerCamelCase |
| `states` | Named preconditions; each one is an e2e fixture (below) |
| `slices` | The model itself, in timeline order |

## Slices

| `type` | Shape | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `command` | `actor`, `screen`, `command`, `events`, `specs` | A person on a screen issues a command; it produces events |
| `view` | `read_model`, `screens` | A read model built from events, shown on screens |
| `automation` | `trigger` (an event or `clock`), `reads`, `command`, `events`, `specs` | The system reacts to an event or to time |
| `translation` | `external`, `trigger` (an event, `clock` or `external`), `reads`, `command`, `events`, `specs` | An outside system answers; its data enters as `ext` |

Every slice has an `id` (`S16`, `V06`, `A05`, `T09`: unique, stable, tests are tagged with it) and a `name`.
A command slice lists every error its command can return: `errors: [InsufficientCredits, NegativeBalance]`.
Optional: `rules: [<rule id>]` the slice depends on, `questions: ["…"]`, `reqs: [<requirement id>]` (the `spec`
part traces requirements through it; `em.py` ignores it).

## Where every field comes from

The checker traces every field back to its origin. Information completeness: nothing appears from nowhere.

| In | Allowed sources |
|---|---|
| a command field | `input` (the person types it), `<ReadModel>.<field>` (the person picks it on the screen; the read model must be shown on the slice's screen), `<Event>.<field>` (the trigger of an automation or translation), `ext` (translation only), `system` |
| an event field | `cmd` (the command's field of the same name), `system`, `ext` (translation only), `rule:<id>`, `<Event>.<field>` (the trigger), `<ReadModel>.<field>` (on the screen, or in `reads`) |
| a read-model field | a list of `<Event>.<field>`, `<Event>` (the fact that it happened), `config`, `rule:<id>` |

## Specs

Write every spec in the full form: it is what a test writer turns into an e2e test.

```yaml
specs:
  - name: a ready static ad is charged at the estimate     # unique in the slice; the test's title
    given: subscribedSellerWithProduct                     # a named state = the fixture
    when: {adType: static, modelQuality: GPT25_high_2K, variations: 1}   # the command's inputs
    external: {AIModels: succeeds}                         # outcomes of outside systems the test forces
    after: periodEnd                                       # time that passes first (needs clock: true)
    then:
      events: [GenerationRequested]                        # domain outcome of this slice (optional)
      see:                                                 # what the person sees afterwards
        - {screen: MyAdsPage, field: MyAds.status, is: succeeded}
        - {screen: CreditsDialog, field: CreditBalance.total, is: 2331}
    covers: [rule:generation-cost/static/GPT25_high_2K]    # decision-table rows this example pins down
    question: "…"                                          # open question: the test writer marks the test fixme
  - name: without credits the request is refused
    given: sellerWithProduct
    when: {adType: static, modelQuality: GPT25_high_2K, variations: 1}
    then: {error: InsufficientCredits}
```

- `when` keys are the command's fields: typed (`input`) or picked on screen (`<ReadModel>.<field>`). Values that
  come from elsewhere belong to the state.
- `see` items name a screen that renders the read model, and a field of it, with the expected value.
- A spec is **e2e-ready** when it has a `name`, a `given` state, and a `see` or an `error`.
- An `error` must be one of the slice's `errors`.

## Test readiness

The model is written for the people and agents who will test the system. `em.py check` lists the **test
obligations** an exhaustive e2e set has to cover, and which e2e-ready example pins each one down:

| Obligation | Pinned down by |
|---|---|
| each command's success | an example of that slice with `see` |
| each error in a command slice's `errors` | an example of that slice with that `error` |
| each outcome of an outside system | an example with `external: {X: outcome}` |
| each slice triggered by `clock` | an example of that slice with `after` |
| each row of a decision table the slices use | an example with `covers: [rule:<id>/<inputs…>]` |
| each field of a read model shown on a screen | an example whose `see` checks it |

An obligation without an example is a gap in the spec, not in the tests: a test writer cannot know the expected
result. `em.py check --all` lists every one; `em.py check --strict` fails while any is not pinned down, which makes
it the check of a spec that tests are derived from.

The short domain form is still accepted, for models that are not ready for tests yet; the checker counts it as
not e2e-ready:

```yaml
- {given: [ProductCreated], when: RequestGeneration, then: error InsufficientCredits}
```

## States

A state is a precondition with a name, written as the events that produced it. It becomes one Playwright fixture
(see the `fixture-modify` part).

```yaml
states:
  freshSeller: {given: [AccountRegistered, DefaultBrandCreated], note: "a new account"}
  sellerWithProduct: {extends: freshSeller, given: [ProductCreated], note: "one product with three photos"}
```

- Name it after the state, not the action: `sellerWithProduct`, never `createProduct`.
- One state adds one thing to its parent, at most three levels deep.
- `note` holds the concrete values the fixture must produce (plan, balance, counts).

## Rules

```yaml
rules:
  plan-credits:
    kind: table
    inputs: [Plan, Period]           # domains
    output: credits_per_period
    rows:
      - [Starter, monthly, 850]
  wallet-order:
    kind: formula
    text: "UNKNOWN: which wallet is debited first"
    unknown: true                    # not invented: a warning wherever it is used
```

The checker lists every input combination a table does not cover and every overlap.

## Handoff to the test writer

`em.py export <model> [--out FILE]` writes the model as JSON, contract `event-model/1`. A test writer reads only
this, so the model and the tests stay independent:

| Key | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `externals` | each outside system and its outcomes, with the fixture name that forces each one |
| `screens` | route, Page Object property, the read models shown |
| `states` | `extends`, `given` events, `note` with the values, `chain` from the first state |
| `slices` | id, type, command, the inputs a person gives, `errors`, events, `reqs`, questions |
| `examples` | per example: `slice`, `name`, `e2e_ready`, `state`, `inputs`, `external`, `after`, `see`, `error`, `covers`, `question`, `reqs` |
| `obligations` | per test obligation: `kind`, `what`, and the examples that pin it down (`pinned_by`) |
| `questions` | every open question, by slice and example |

Ids are stable: tests are tagged with the slice id and titled with the example name, so a renamed example is a
changed test. The contract changes only with a new version string.
