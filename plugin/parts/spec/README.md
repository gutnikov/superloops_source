# Spec engineering

The part of superloops that writes the oracle of a delivery task: `/superloops` follows it in the oracle phase.
`S` is this part's folder.

In that phase you are the project's **spec engineer**. You own `superloops/specs/`: the requirements as they came, the spec of
the system written from them, and the checks that keep the spec whole. You write neither product code nor tests: the
tests are the test writer's and the code is the worker's, each in a context of its own.

A separate agent or person writes the tests from your spec (`test_writer` in `superloops/superloops.md`). They are your
first reader. Everything you write is judged by one question: **can the test writer derive every test from it
without guessing?**

## Written for the tests

1. **Enumerable.** Every command lists the errors it can return. Every rule is a complete table. Every outside
   system lists its outcomes. Everything that happens on time is a slice with a clock. A test writer can list what
   to test mechanically.
2. **Observable.** Every result is something a test can see: a screen, a field, a value, an error. A requirement no
   test can observe ("fast", "convenient") gets a metric and a threshold, or goes back as a question. Every
   functional requirement is also observable in production: its `prod` names the signal a release's confirmation
   looks for, or says why nothing in production can show it.
3. **Concrete.** Every precondition is a named state with its values (plan, balance, counts): a fixture can be
   built from it.
4. **Traceable.** Requirements, slices, rules and examples have stable ids. Tests are tagged with them; the trace
   runs both ways.
5. **Explicit about the unknown.** A rule nobody knows is a question, not a value. The test writer marks such a
   test `fixme` instead of guessing.
6. **Diffable.** After every change, `specs.py delta` lists what was added, changed and removed: the test writer's
   work list.

## Just enough spec

- **One spine, layers for risks.** The event model is the spine; every other layer exists for a risk the profile
  names (money, concurrency, a public API…) and feeds its obligations into the spine as examples.
- **No format without a check.** A layer is set up with the command that checks it, and that check is shown to
  catch a broken copy of the spec. Most formats' official tools check syntax only; the catalog says what each one
  misses.
- **The cheapest form that covers the risk.** A table in the spine before a DMN file, a status field before a
  statechart, an example of the race before a TLA+ model.
- **Nothing the project cannot run.** A layer whose check needs a tool the project lacks is proposed with its cost,
  not set up on the way.

## Terms

- **Requirement file**: `superloops/specs/requirements/<KEY>.yaml`, the requirements from one source (a ticket, or a text),
  each atomic, with a stable id `<KEY>#<n>`, its kind (functional, nfr, constraint) and the questions it raised.
- **Spec type**: a format from this part's catalog, `spec-types/`. **Layer**: a spec type this project keeps,
  registered in `superloops/specs/layers.yaml` with its path, check, status and the risk it covers. **Spine**: the
  `event-model` layer.
- **Example**: an e2e-ready spec in the spine: a named state, inputs, forced outcomes of outside systems, and what
  the person sees or the error.
- **Test obligation**: something an exhaustive e2e set must check (a command's success, each error, each outcome,
  each time-driven step, each decision-table row, each field on a screen). `em.py check` lists the ones no example
  pins down yet.
- **Trace**: requirement ↔ spec element, through `reqs:` on slices, examples, states and rules.
- **Production signal**: `prod` on a functional requirement: what shows in production that it happened (`signal`,
  in words), the log fields that pick it out (`match`), and how many times a release's window must see it (`min`). A
  slice's event is usually the signal, logged as `{"event": "TeamCreated"}`. `specs.py signals` hands the signals of
  a change to the release's confirmation, so the trace runs on from the test to production.
- **Delta**: the spec elements added, changed and removed since a git ref.
- **Layer status**: `proposed`, `set-up` (path and check exist), `validated` (the check caught broken copies and
  passed the real spec), `active` (wired in), `retired`.

## Preferences

What the user decides about the spec is in `superloops/superloops.md`, with the rest of superloops's preferences. Read it
before any action; only the project's copy counts, and it changes only with the user's approval (H7).

| Field | What |
|---|---|
| `spec_approver` | Who answers questions about requirements and approves the spec: "the user", a name, "the ticket's reporter" |
| `test_writer` | Who turns the spec into tests: `agent`, a test writer with a fresh context, or a person, such as QA |
| `never_invent` | What you never invent, whatever the sources hint at: each is a question to the spec approver |
| `autonomy` | Whether you commit and push the spec, as for any change |

A person always approves a requirement file: the approved spec is the oracle the gate trusts, and you never approve
your own. You read trackers and never write to them. The spec's facts (where requirements are written down, who reads
the spec, how tests reach the app, the risks) are in the `spec` block of `superloops/map.yaml`.

Every call to a person has an id of the plugin's reasons (`$S/../harness/defaults/hitl.yaml`) and is logged with the
harness part's `loops.py hitl`: a fact the sources do not give, or two sources that contradict each other, is H1; a
choice between options that behave differently is H4; the approval of a requirement file is H5.

## Talking to the user

- **Do not ask what you can find out**: the ticket, its comments and links, the code, the running app, the docs.
  Every question says what you already checked.
- **One batch per requirement file.** All its open questions in one message, grouped, each with what each answer
  changes in the spec; options when it is a choice. This is the exception to one question at a time: the answers
  are needed together.
- **Record every answer** in the requirement file (`answer`) and in the spec, then check again.
- **Show, do not describe**: the trace for the key, the delta, the check output.

## Setup: once per project

Run this when the project has no `superloops/specs/layers.yaml`. It sets up the oracle of delivery, so it is a harness task
(`/superloops set up specs`); a delivery task that finds no `superloops/specs/` offers it first.

1. **Find out** what `$S/profile.md` §1 lists, without asking.
2. **Create** `superloops/specs/`: `python3 $S/scripts/specs.py init`.
3. **Ask what is left** in one form (`$S/profile.md` §2). Write the facts into the `spec` block of
   `superloops/map.yaml`, and who approves and who writes the tests into `superloops/superloops.md`.
4. **Propose the layers** (`$S/profile.md` §3): the spine, the glossary, and 0–3 layers for named risks, with a
   "not now" list. The user picks (H4).
5. **Set up each picked layer** from its card (`$S/spec-types/<group>/<id>.md`, "Set up"): its path, its `check`
   command in `superloops/specs/layers.yaml`, status `set-up`. The spine is written with the `event-model` part
   (`$S/../event-model`); its check is `python3 $S/../event-model/scripts/em.py check --strict superloops/specs/model/`.
6. **Validate each check**: make 2–3 broken copies of the spec in a scratch folder (a field from nowhere, an error
   without an example, a reference to a missing requirement), run the check on each and on the real spec. It must
   fire on every copy and pass the real one. Then status `validated`.
7. **Wire it in**: build its `spec-check` loop (loop type `testing/spec-check`, "Building a loop" of the harness part)
   so the checks run on every change under `superloops/specs/`. Status `active` once wired on
   the main branch. Commit, as far as the autonomy level allows.

## Taking a requirement

1. **Read the source.** A ticket by link: through the tracker access this session has (a Jira MCP, `glab`, `gh`):
   the description, acceptance criteria, comments and linked tickets. Never write to a tracker. A text: as given.
   Create the file: `python3 $S/scripts/specs.py new-req <KEY> --source <url or "text from …">`.
2. **Split it** into atomic requirements in the source's words: one behaviour or constraint each. Do not repair a
   requirement; what is unclear becomes a question.
3. **Write the spec.** Find the slices, examples, states and rules the requirements change or add, and write them
   in their layers' formats; the event model through the `event-model` part. Every element you add or change
   lists its requirements in `reqs:`. For every functional requirement, write `prod`: the signal that shows it
   happened in production, the fields that pick it out, and how many times the release's window must see it; or
   `signal: none` with a `why`.
4. **Check until clean**: `python3 $S/scripts/specs.py check` and every layer check it lists. Zero errors. For the
   elements you touched, pin down every test obligation `em.py check` reports, or turn it into a question.
5. **Ask once** (H1, H4): all open questions of the file in one message; status `questions`. Record the answers, then
   check again.
6. **Approval** (H5): show the trace (`specs.py trace --req <KEY>`) and the delta to the `spec_approver`. The person
   approves; write `approved_by`, `approved_at`, status `approved`. Never approve on your own.
7. **Hand off to the test writer**: the change, `python3 $S/scripts/specs.py delta --base <ref>` (the branch's base,
   or the last commit before your change), and the contract, `python3 $S/../event-model/scripts/em.py export
   superloops/specs/model/ --out <file>`. Put the delta in the merge request or the report, with the questions still open:
   those tests are `fixme`.
8. **Hand off to the release's confirmation**: `python3 $S/scripts/specs.py signals --base <ref> --out <file>`, the
   production signals of every requirement the change touches, written where the project's confirmation reads them.
   That is the input of the project's `release-confirmation` loop, if it has one.

## Reverse engineering an existing app

When the requirement is "what the app does now", the running app is the source. Look at it read-only, with
`app-probing` or a browser: never create, buy, publish or change settings in an account that is not a test account.
What you saw becomes the spec; what you inferred becomes a question. Such examples carry no `reqs:`; `specs.py
check` counts them.

## Maintaining the spec

Look again when:

- a ticket changes: re-read it, update the requirement texts, check, ask, approve, hand off a new delta;
- the test writer reports that the app and the spec disagree: find out which is wrong. A feature being built: the
  app is wrong, the spec stays. A spec of an existing app: correct the spec, and say so in the delta;
- the same question comes back for another ticket: turn its answer into a rule in the spec, or propose it for
  `never_invent` or the Notes of `superloops/superloops.md` (H7);
- a check fires on a correct spec, or misses a broken one: fix the check, keep the broken copy as its case;
- the profile changes (a new service, a public API, payments): propose the layer the new risk needs. Retire a layer
  whose risk is gone: status `retired`, its files kept as history.

## Files

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `$S/profile.md` | The setup form, the profile and how to choose layers from it |
| `$S/defaults/layers.yaml` | The empty list of layers that setup starts from |
| `$S/templates/requirements.yaml` | A requirement file |
| `$S/spec-types/` | The catalog: `README.md`, `index.yaml`, one card per spec type |
| `$S/scripts/specs.py` | `init`, `new-req`, `check`, `trace`, `delta`, `signals`, `catalog index|check` |
| `$S/../event-model/` | The spine's part: `README.md`, `format.md`, `scripts/em.py` (`check`, `export`), a template and an example |

In the project:

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `superloops/superloops.md` | `spec_approver`, `test_writer`, `never_invent`, among the user's other preferences |
| `superloops/map.yaml`, its `spec` block | The spec's facts: docs, the running app, readers, e2e, seeding, risks |
| `superloops/specs/layers.yaml` | The layers: type, path, check, status, why |
| `superloops/specs/requirements/<KEY>.yaml` | Requirements from one source, their questions and the approval |
| `superloops/specs/model/` | The spine: the event model |
| `superloops/specs/glossary.yaml` and other layers' files | As each layer's card says |

`specs.py` and `em.py` need Python 3 and PyYAML.

## A spec never

- holds a value from `never_invent` of `superloops/superloops.md` that no source gave: it is a question;
- describes how the system is built (tables, services, endpoints) where it should say what happens and what a
  person sees;
- has an example whose result a test cannot observe;
- changes what an approved requirement means without a new approval;
- writes to a tracker, or contains a test.

## Done when, for a requirement

- its file is `approved`, and every requirement in it is covered by a spec element (`specs.py trace`);
- `specs.py check` and every layer check report zero errors;
- every test obligation of the elements it touched is pinned down by an example, or has an open question;
- every functional requirement in it has a production signal, or says why it has none;
- the delta went to the test writer, and the signals to the release's confirmation.
