# <title>

## Requirement

<The failure this loop prevents, who asked for it, and its place: the super-loop and the phase that should have
caught the failure, such as `delivery/gate`. One or two sentences.>

## Loop

<What happens, step by step: what triggers it, what it checks, what the agent sees, what the agent does next.>

## Tools

<Each tool the loop runs, with the version it was validated with and how it is installed.>

## Signal

<What `run` prints when it fires: the format and one real example. It names the place and says how to fix it.>

## Validation

<What makes this loop trustworthy: the must-fire and must-pass cases and what each one stands for; for an agent
step, its evals; for a manual validation, why cases are not possible and what is checked instead.>

## Wiring

<Each place the loop is hooked in and what it does there.>
