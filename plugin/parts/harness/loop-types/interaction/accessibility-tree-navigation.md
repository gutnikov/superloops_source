# Agent navigation by the accessibility tree

## Loop

Playwright MCP gives the agent an accessibility snapshot of the page instead of pixels. If the agent cannot find
a button by its role and name, the source reads that one miss as two signals at once: the page has poor accessibility,
and the scenario does not work.

## Set up

- Playwright MCP or playwright-cli.

## Notes

- `browser_run_code_unsafe` in Playwright MCP is effectively remote code execution.
