# CI on clean infrastructure

## Loop

The agent pushes; autofixes apply themselves; the agent fixes the remaining failures locally.

## Set up

- Machine-readable logs (`gh run view --log-failed`).
- A limit on CI rounds. Stripe runs lint locally first, then gives the agent at most two CI rounds; beyond two, the returns drop.

## Agent step

An investigator reads the failing job's log and returns a Diagnosis: the cause, the log lines that show it, the next
step. It keeps thousands of log lines out of the working agent's context. It never blocks; the CI job does.
