# Stop hook / `/goal`

## Loop

A hook runs a check and does not let the agent end its turn until the check passes.

**Limit:** in Claude Code, a Stop hook blocks the end of a turn no more than 8 times in a row. After the 8th block, the turn ends even if the check still fails.

## Set up

- A Stop hook in Claude Code.
- Or `/goal` with a separate evaluator.

## Notes

- With these mechanisms, an autonomous run can finish without a person. With a Stop hook, the run ends when the check passes, or after 8 blocks in a row. A passing check shows only what the script tests.
- Hooks make a check mandatory; CLAUDE.md is only advice.

## Agent step

With `/goal`, the separate evaluator is a refuter: it gets the goal and the state of the work and returns a Verdict.
A hook may block the end of a turn on it only once it is calibrated
([agent-calibration](../meta/agent-calibration.md)); a script check needs no agent.
