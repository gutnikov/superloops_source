# Snapshot / golden / approved fixtures

## Loop

A test compares the output with a reference. When the test shows a diff:

- if the diff is unexpected, the agent fixes it
- if the diff is expected, the agent proposes it to a person as the new reference

## Set up

- References live in the repository.
- The agent may not approve new references itself.

## Notes

- Böckeler reports good results with the approved-fixtures pattern where it applies.
- Who approves the references: [human-acceptance-criteria](../human/human-acceptance-criteria.md).

## Agent step

A guard sorts each changed reference: explained by the requirement of the change (expected) or not (a regression),
with the evidence. A person still approves new references. It blocks only once calibrated
([agent-calibration](../meta/agent-calibration.md)).
