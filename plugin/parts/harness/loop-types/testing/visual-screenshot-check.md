# Visual check with screenshots

## Loop

The agent takes a screenshot, compares it with the mockup, lists the differences and fixes them.

## Set up

Set it up in two places:

- Locally: give the agent the prompt from the Claude Code docs: "take a screenshot of the result and compare it to the original".
- In CI: run pixel regression.

Locally, the [`app-probing`](../../../app-probing/README.md) part of superloops takes a full-page screenshot once the screen has settled; the
comparison with the mockup stays with the agent.

## Agent step

A judge compares the screenshot with the mockup and returns a Verdict listing each difference. Comparing images is
judgement: it blocks only after a person graded pairs that match and pairs that do not, and it agreed with them
([agent-calibration](../meta/agent-calibration.md)).
