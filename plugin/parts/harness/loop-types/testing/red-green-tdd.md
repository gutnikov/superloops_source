# Unit tests, red/green TDD

## Loop

The agent writes a test and makes sure it fails (red). Then it writes the implementation until the run is green,
and refactors.

## Set up

To set up the loop:

- Add "use red/green TDD" to the agent's prompt. Simon Willison says any good model understands this shorthand.
  Kent Beck states the rule as: "Always follow the TDD cycle: Red → Green → Refactor".
- Stop the agent from deleting or weakening tests, for example by disabling a test or removing its assertions
  (see Notes). The source names two guards: a hook, and a review of the test diff. It does not say what the hook
  checks or who reviews the diff.
- Use checks the agent cannot edit as the final ones: CI, mutation testing, production.

## Notes

- Kent Beck names as a warning sign "any indication that the genie was cheating, for example by disabling or
  deleting tests". He also describes the agent deleting assertions and faking the implementation.

## Agent step

A guard: a reviewer whose only lens is the test diff. It returns a Verdict on whether the change weakened a test
(deleted, skipped, a loosened assertion, a changed expected value, the code under test mocked out). That answers who
reviews the test diff. It blocks only once calibrated on weakened and honest test diffs
([agent-calibration](../meta/agent-calibration.md)).
