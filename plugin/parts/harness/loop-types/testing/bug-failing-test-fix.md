# Bug → failing test → fix

## Loop

The agent reproduces the bug with a test, fixes the code and shows a green run. The source does not say whether that run covers only the new test or the whole test suite.

At OpenAI the agent also records a video before and after the fix. The source does not say what the video shows, which bugs it is for or how to set it up.

## Set up

Give the agent this prompt: "write a failing test that reproduces the issue, then fix it". The source names no other step and does not say where the prompt goes.

For a bug in a web app's UI, the [`app-probing`](../../../app-probing/README.md) part of superloops reproduces it in the running app first, on the
state a fixture creates and through Page Objects; the failing test is then written on the same fixture and Page
Objects.

## Notes

The source describes only the case where the new test fails, the fix makes it pass and nothing else goes wrong. It does not say what to do if:

- the new test passes before the fix, so it does not reproduce the bug
- the agent changes the test instead of the code
- an automated test cannot catch the bug, for example because the bug is flaky, depends on the environment or shows only in the UI

## Agent step

An explorer reproduces the bug in the running app before the test is written and returns the steps the test will
follow. It does not block.
