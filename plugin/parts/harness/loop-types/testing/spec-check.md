# Spec check

## Loop

The agent changes the spec under `superloops/specs/` and runs `specs.py check` and the check of each spec layer, such as
`em.py check --strict` for the event model. A field that comes from nowhere, an error with no example, a decision-table row
no example checks, or a requirement no spec element covers comes back as a message that names the element and what
is missing. The test writer gets the spec only after the check is clean, with `specs.py delta` as the list of what
to add, change and delete in the tests.

## Set up

- The [`spec`](../../../spec/README.md) part of superloops: `specs.py` and, for the event model, `em.py` of the
  [`event-model`](../../../event-model/README.md) part.
  `superloops/specs/layers.yaml` lists each layer's check command.
- `run`: `specs.py check` followed by every layer's `check`; it fails when any of them fails.
- Cases: broken copies of the spec in `cases/must-fire/` (a field from nowhere, a command error without an example,
  a `reqs:` reference to a missing requirement), the real spec in `cases/must-pass/`.
- Wiring: a Claude Code Stop hook or a pre-commit hook on changes under `superloops/specs/`, and a CI job.

## Notes

- The official tools of most spec formats check syntax only: the Context Mapper CLI passed 7 of 7 seeded semantic
  defects, `gherkin-lint` 7 of 7. The semantic checks are the spec part's own.
- The check proves the spec is whole, not that it is right: approval of a requirement stays with a person.
