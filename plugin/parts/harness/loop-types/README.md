# Loop types

A coding agent becomes autonomous when every action it takes has a check that the agent runs itself and that
returns an unambiguous, machine-readable signal: an exit code, `file:line:message`, JSON, a screenshot, or the
answer to a log query. Almost every quality attribute (the "-ilities") can be turned into such a sensor, not just
testability and observability. This approach is now called harness engineering.

This catalog has one file per loop type: a pattern the harness engineer turns into a concrete loop in a project.

- 80 automated loop types in 11 groups. 71 come from the research "Feedback loops for an autonomous
  coding agent: a catalog by quality attributes" (unpublished, in Russian; it says 70 cycles but lists 71). Nine were added
  here: [review of document texts](meta/document-review.md), built on the `text-quality` part;
  [the spec check](testing/spec-check.md), built on the `spec` part;
  [the acceptance loop](meta/acceptance-loop.md), a composite loop from requirements to green acceptance tests;
  [the calibration of a loop's agent](meta/agent-calibration.md); and five that the super-loops need:
  [triage](meta/triage.md), [the reproduction gate](meta/reproduction-gate.md),
  [behaviour invariance](meta/behaviour-invariance.md), [release confirmation](production/release-confirmation.md)
  and [the discovery decision](meta/discovery-decision.md).
- 16 [human-in-the-loop loop types](human/README.md), where a person gives the signal.

Every loop type has a place in a project's [super-loops](../super-loops/README.md) (delivery, remediation, maintenance
and discovery): a super-loop and one of its phases, such as `delivery/gate`. The `places` field of a card lists them,
`index.yaml` lists the loop types of every place under `by_place`, and the Phases table of each super-loop names the
same types. The `stages` field says something else: where the loop runs, such as `ci` or `production`.

## File format

```yaml
---
id: red-green-tdd            # the file name; stable, used to refer to the loop
title: "Unit tests, red/green TDD"
group: testing               # the folder
qualities: [testability, correctness]
stages: [local]              # where the loop runs; omitted when the research does not say
speed: [seconds]             # how long one round takes; omitted when the research does not say
places: [delivery/work, remediation/work]   # where it serves in the super-loops: <super-loop>/<phase>
needs: [browser]             # what the agent must reach from its session; omitted when it needs nothing beyond the repo
---
```

`places` is required. A place at the harness level, where the loops of the harness itself are built and fixed, has
the prefix `harness:`, as in `harness:remediation/entry`. A place's phase must be one its super-loop has: discovery
has no `release`. The values of `needs` are the keys of `tools` in a project's profile (`ci`, `logs`, `errors`,
`metrics`, `traces`, `browser`, `deploy`), so `loops.py candidates <place>` can tell which loop types a project can
run.

The body has the sections **Loop** (what the agent does and what signal it gets), **Set up** (what has to exist
for the loop to work), **Notes** (evidence and warnings, when there are any) and **Sources**.

A card where a separate agent helps has an `agent:` field and an **Agent step** section: what kind of agent, what
it gets, what it returns, and whether it may block. The section is this harness's guidance, not the source's. The
kinds are a vocabulary, not a whitelist: a project may need an agent no card names.

| `agent` value | What it does | Blocks? |
|---|---|---|
| `reviewer` | reads a diff or an artifact through a lens or a checklist, returns findings; a guard is a reviewer whose lens is the tests, references or spec | only once calibrated |
| `refuter` | tries to prove a claim of "done" wrong, by running tests and opening the app | only once calibrated |
| `judge` | grades a result on a rubric | only once calibrated on a person's grades |
| `explorer` | walks the running app like a user, returns what it saw and the defects | no: what it finds becomes a test |
| `investigator` | reads logs, traces, profiles or a CI log, returns a diagnosis | no: it helps the working agent |
| `worker` | does a narrow task on a schedule, returns a small PR | no: the loops on its PR decide |

What every agent returns is fixed in [../agent-formats.md](../agent-formats.md); how an agent earns the right to
block is [agent-calibration](meta/agent-calibration.md).

| `stages` value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `edit` | After every file edit (a hook, the language server) |
| `local` | The agent runs it in its own workspace |
| `commit` | Pre-commit or pre-push hook |
| `ci` | CI on clean infrastructure |
| `preview` | A per-PR preview environment |
| `staging` | Staging |
| `production` | Production |
| `scheduled` | On a schedule: nightly, periodically, in batches |
| `task` | At the start or end of every task or session |
| `sprint` | Once per sprint |
| `continuous` | All the time |

`speed`: `sub-second`, `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days`, `weeks`.

Human-in-the-loop loop types replace `qualities` with four axes and use slightly different sections; see
[human/README.md](human/README.md#file-format).

[index.yaml](index.yaml) lists every loop type with its path, a one-line summary (from its Loop) and its frontmatter, so
a tool or an agent can choose loop types without opening each card. It is generated: after changing a card, run
`python3 ../scripts/catalog.py index`; `python3 ../scripts/catalog.py check` validates every card and fails when
the index is out of date.

## Terms

From Birgitta Böckeler (Thoughtworks), "Harness engineering for coding agent users":

- **Guides** act before the agent acts: AGENTS.md, skills, LSP.
- **Sensors** give feedback after it acts: tests, linters, logs, the browser, reviewer agents. Every loop in
  this catalog is a sensor.
- Both are either **computational** (deterministic, seconds) or **inferential** (LLM-as-judge: more expensive and
  non-deterministic).
- With sensors only, the agent repeats the same mistakes. With guides only, it never learns whether the rules
  worked.

Behaviour is the hardest to check: tests the agent wrote itself are not enough. Independent behaviour checks are
the most valuable: [mutation testing](testing/mutation-testing.md),
[property-based tests](testing/property-based-tests.md), [approved fixtures](testing/approved-fixtures.md),
[e2e](testing/e2e-browser.md), a separate [verification agent](meta/verification-subagent.md).

## What makes a loop fit for an agent

1. **One known command.** It is written in CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md, or described in `--help`. A CLI costs less
   context than a GUI.
2. **Speed fits its place in the process.** Seconds for every edit, minutes in CI, hours on a schedule. "Keep
   quality left" (Böckeler).
3. **Determinism.** A flaky sensor teaches the agent to ignore the signal.
4. **Machine-readable, compact output.** An exit code, `file:line:message`, JSON or SARIF.
5. **A fix instruction in the error message.** Where a rule had none, Böckeler saw the agent raise the
   complexity threshold instead.
6. **Protection from bypass.** The agent may disable or delete tests (Kent Beck: "any indication that the genie
   was cheating"). Sensors the agent can edit need protection; the final ones must be out of its reach: CI,
   mutations, production.
7. **Isolation.** A sandbox lets the agent run without confirming each action.
8. **Enforced by hooks, not by the prompt.** CLAUDE.md is advice; hooks are deterministic.

## Where to start

The order below is for a project that has none of these loops. Do not build every step: choose by the project's
profile and the failures it has ([../profile.md](../profile.md)).

1. **`verify` in one command**: [build](code/build.md), [types](code/type-check.md),
   [lint](code/lint-with-fix-instructions.md) and [unit tests](testing/red-green-tdd.md), plus the
   [formatting hook](code/autoformat-hook.md) and the [Stop hook](deployability/stop-hook.md). Boris Cherny: "give
   Claude a way to verify its work. If Claude has that feedback loop, it will 2-3x the quality of the final
   result".
2. **Behaviour**: [red/green TDD](testing/red-green-tdd.md) with protected tests,
   [mutations on the diff](testing/mutation-testing.md), [property-based tests](testing/property-based-tests.md).
   When requirements come as tickets or texts: the [acceptance loop](meta/acceptance-loop.md), which makes them
   the oracle.
3. **The agent sees the app**: [an app per worktree](deployability/isolated-environment.md),
   [Playwright](testing/e2e-browser.md) with [screenshots](testing/visual-screenshot-check.md),
   [axe](interaction/accessibility-checks.md), `init.sh`.
4. **Observability in dev**: [structured logs](observability/structured-logs.md),
   [OTel](observability/traces-opentelemetry.md), an ephemeral telemetry stack,
   [performance budgets](performance/perf-budgets-telemetry.md).
5. **CI gates**: [fitness functions](code/architecture-fitness-functions.md), [Semgrep](security/sast.md),
   [GitLeaks](security/secret-scanning.md), [SCA](security/dependency-scanning-sbom.md) and
   [licenses](security/license-check.md), [oasdiff or buf](compatibility/api-breaking-changes.md),
   [Squawk or Atlas](compatibility/db-migration-lint.md), [size-limit](performance/bundle-size-budget.md) or
   [Lighthouse](performance/lighthouse-ci.md), [Pact](testing/contract-tests.md). A
   [limited number of CI rounds](deployability/ci-clean-infra.md).
6. **Production and the inferential layer**: [Sentry MCP](production/error-tracking.md),
   [SLOs](production/slo-degradation.md), [canaries](deployability/canary-feature-flags.md), and the
   [release confirmation](production/release-confirmation.md) that closes delivery,
   [reviewer agents](meta/agent-code-review.md), [garbage collection](meta/garbage-collection.md),
   [evals](meta/llm-evals.md). A [UX evaluator](interaction/ux-evaluator.md) only where a single model cannot
   do the job reliably.
7. **Always: the [steering loop](meta/steering-loop.md).** Turn every escape and every repeated mistake into code
   (a lint or a test) rather than into text.

## Caveats

- The OpenAI and Stripe numbers are the companies' own reports. OpenAI writes that the result "depends heavily
  on the specific structure and tooling of this repository".
- A harness that checks behaviour is not solved yet. No sensor can check correctness if a person has not
  specified what they want. The [acceptance loop](meta/acceptance-loop.md) is this catalog's answer: the person
  specifies once, as an approved spec, and acceptance tests derived from it check every change.
- Too many rules can drive the agent into a "spiral of over-engineered refactorings" (Böckeler).
- Inferential sensors are expensive and non-deterministic; run them selectively, and let one block only after it
  is [calibrated](meta/agent-calibration.md).
- Production data is untrusted input. `browser_run_code_unsafe` in Playwright MCP is effectively remote code
  execution.
- The ISO/IEC 25010:2023 sub-characteristics were checked against secondary sources only (the standard is paid).
  Some tools (k6, Trivy, ZAP, cargo-fuzz) reflect common practice and were not checked separately.
