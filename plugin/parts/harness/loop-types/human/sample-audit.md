# Sample audit

## Loop

Periodically the person reviews a random sample of what the agent did or merged without them, and marks where it
differs from what they expected.

## Getting a good signal

- The sample is random, not "the most suspicious": otherwise systematic errors stay invisible.
- The share of mismatches in the sample shows whether the agent can get more autonomy in the work that the sample covers. The note calls this share a direct measure. It does not say what share is acceptable or how many items to sample.

## When and how long

On a schedule (for example, weekly); 30–60 minutes.

## Sources

The note gives no primary source: this loop generalizes common practice.
