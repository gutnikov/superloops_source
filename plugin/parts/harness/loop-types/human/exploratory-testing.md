# Exploratory testing

## Loop

The person tries the product by hand and writes a bug report; the agent reproduces the bug with a failing test and
fixes it.

## Getting a good signal

To get a good signal from this loop:

- Give people a bug report template with fields for steps, expected result, actual result and environment.
- Turn each manual finding into a regression test, so the person never has to catch the same bug again.

## When and how long

On a preview or staging; hours.

## Agent step

An explorer reproduces the person's bug report on a fresh state and returns the steps that reproduce it, or why it
does not reproduce. It does not block; the failing test written from its steps does.
