# Traces (OpenTelemetry)

## Loop

The agent queries traces (TraceQL) and finds a slow or failed span.

The source does not say what starts the query, what the agent does with the span, or how it checks that its fix worked.

## Set up

- The OTel SDK.
- A local collector.

Example: in the cited post, OpenAI uses Vector → VictoriaTraces. Vector passes traces on to VictoriaTraces. The source gives this as OpenAI's own setup, not as a requirement.

## Agent step

An investigator runs the trace queries and returns the slow or failed span, why it is slow or failed, and the next
step, as a Diagnosis. It never blocks.
