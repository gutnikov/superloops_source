# UI prototypes

A part of superloops: `/superloops` uses it in the work of discovery, to show an idea before it is built.

A **prototype** is one file that composes the project's design-system components into a screen. A dev server shows
it at `http://localhost:<port>/<name>`. It is a reference for a feature, not the feature: it makes no API calls and
never ships.

## What lives in the project

As little as possible. Every file you add is one more the team carries, so add only these:

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `<host>/prototypes/vite.config.mjs` | the runner: serves the prototypes; from `$S/templates/vite.config.mjs` |
| `<host>/prototypes/README.md` | that this folder is maintained by superloops, the command, and the design-system catalog |
| `<host>/prototypes/<name>.tsx` | one per prototype |
| `"proto"` in `<host>/package.json` | the script that starts the server: `vite --config prototypes/vite.config.mjs` |

No `index.html`, entry file, `tsconfig`, Storybook or new dependency: the runner makes the page and the entry itself.
`<host>` is the package that depends on the design system, `react`, `react-dom` and `vite`: the app in a monorepo
(`apps/web`), or the root in a single-package project. Prototypes must sit inside it, so that their imports resolve
from its `node_modules`.

## Rules

- **Only the design system.** A prototype imports what `allow` in the runner's settings lists (the design system and
  `react`) and files in its folder. The runner refuses any other import, with the file and line, on the page. That
  is what keeps a prototype from growing into a feature.
- **Components before `className`.** Build from the design system's components and layout primitives; use utility
  classes or tokens for the one-off. A prototype built from the real parts reads as the product.
- **Data that breaks layouts.** Fill lists with long names, large numbers, missing fields and an empty state, not three
  tidy rows. Shared fake data goes in `_<name>.tsx` files in the folder.
- **Use what exists.** If the project already has a way to prototype (a scratchpad route, a Storybook section for
  screens), say so and use it, unless the user asks for this one.
- **Show before you change the project.** The setup's files, the script and any edit to a lint or type-check config
  are shown first and made once the user agrees. Prototypes themselves need no confirmation.

## Talking to the user

- Talk in the user's language.
- Answer with the screen: the URL and a screenshot, not a description.
- Do not ask what you can find out from the code. Ask with the session's question tool, 2–4 options, the
  recommended one first: independent questions together, up to 4 in one call, and a question that depends on
  another's answer after it.

## Setup: once per project

Run this when the project has no `prototypes/vite.config.mjs`.

1. **Find the design system**, without asking:
   - the components: a workspace package (`packages/ui`, `design-system`), a folder (`src/components/ui`), or a library
     in `package.json` (`@mui/material`, `antd`, `@chakra-ui/react`, `@mantine/core`, Radix with shadcn's
     `components/ui`); its entry point and what it exports;
   - how to use them: `*.stories.*`, docs such as `DESIGN.md`, the props in each component's source, and screens in
     the app that compose them;
   - what a screen needs around it: the styles the app's entry point imports first (`main.tsx`, `index.css`), and the
     providers it wraps the app in (theme, translations, query client). A router provider is needed only if the
     components use router hooks or links;
   - the tokens: CSS variables, a Tailwind `@theme`, a theme object;
   - the host package, and whether it has `vite` and `@vitejs/plugin-react`. Note `@tailwindcss/vite` if the app uses
     Tailwind 4.
2. **Check what fits.** The runner is for React with Vite.
   - If the host has no `vite` or `@vitejs/plugin-react`, they are two dev dependencies to add: propose it.
   - Another framework (Vue, Svelte) needs the runner's entry rewritten for it: say so and propose it before you
     write anything.
3. **Write the runner**: copy `$S/templates/vite.config.mjs` to `<host>/prototypes/` and fill in its placeholders and
   `settings`:
   - `styles`: the app's global stylesheet, as a path relative to the folder, or the design system's stylesheet;
   - `frame`: the providers, as `{ module, export }`. If the app has no single component for them, add one small
     `_frame.tsx` to the folder and point at it;
   - `allow`: the design system's import name and `react`;
   - `port`: a free one near 6060;
   - the plugins: drop `tailwindcss` when the app does not use Tailwind 4, and add any plugin the design system needs
     to compile (the app's `vite.config` shows which).
4. **Write the README** from `$S/templates/README.md`: fill in the placeholders and the catalog of components, props,
   tokens and patterns. The catalog is what you read before every prototype, so make it complete and short.
5. **Add the script** `"proto": "vite --config prototypes/vite.config.mjs"` to the host's `package.json`. The one
   command for the user is `pnpm --filter <host> proto` (or `npm run proto -w <host>`) in a monorepo, and
   `npm run proto` otherwise.
6. **Keep the project's checks green.** If the project's lint or type check covers the folder (`biome check .`, an
   `include` of `**/*`), propose excluding it with one line in that config; prototypes are never type-checked or
   linted.
7. **Prove it**: start the server, write a prototype named `example` that uses the most common components, and check
   it (below). Report the command, the URL and a screenshot.

## Making a prototype

1. **Name it**: lowercase letters, digits and hyphens. The name is the file name and the URL.
2. **Read the catalog** in the folder's README, and the source or stories of each component you use, for its props.
3. **Write `<name>.tsx`**:

   ```tsx
   // Invoices waiting for approval, with the oldest first.
   import { Button, Card, Stack, Text } from '@acme/ui';

   export default function InvoiceApprovals() {
     return (
       <Stack gap="lg" className="mx-auto max-w-3xl px-4 py-10">
         <Text variant="display">Invoices</Text>
         <Card title="Waiting on you" actions={<Button size="sm">Approve all</Button>}>
           <Text tone="muted">Three invoices, the oldest from Tuesday.</Text>
         </Card>
       </Stack>
     );
   }
   ```

4. **Make sure the server runs**: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://localhost:<port>/`. If nothing
   answers, start the script in the background and read the URL it prints.
5. **Check it in a browser**: open `http://localhost:<port>/<name>` with the browser tool the session has (Chrome
   DevTools, Playwright, agent-browser). An import the runner refuses or a compile error shows as Vite's overlay; a
   render error shows on the page with its stack; read the console too. Fix it until the page renders clean. Without
   a browser tool, `curl -s http://localhost:<port>/<name>.tsx` returns the compiled module or the error.
6. **Show it**: the URL and a screenshot.

To change a prototype, edit its file. An open page updates itself.

## Open, list, delete

- **Saved.** A prototype is saved once its file exists. It opens again at the same URL whenever the server runs. To
  share it with the team, offer to commit it.
- **Open**: make sure the server runs, then give `http://localhost:<port>/<name>`.
- **List**: the `.tsx` files in the folder, except `_*.tsx`, each with its URL and its first-line comment. The
  server's own list is at `http://localhost:<port>/`.
- **Delete**: name the file and ask, then delete it.

## When the design system changes

New components, renamed props or tokens: update the README's catalog. If the styles or the providers the app loads
changed, update `settings` in the runner. Then open each prototype to see which ones broke, and say which.

## Files

`S` is this part's folder.

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `$S/templates/vite.config.mjs` | The runner: settings, then the code that serves the prototypes |
| `$S/templates/README.md` | The folder's README, with the catalog to fill in |
